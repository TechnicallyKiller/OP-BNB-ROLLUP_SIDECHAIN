# OpBNB Rollup & Sidechain Integration – Design Document

---

## 1. Overview

**OpBNB** is a Layer‑2 scaling solution built atop BNB Smart Chain (BSC), combining the low‑cost, high‑throughput benefits of rollups with the flexibility of sidechains.  

- **Rollups** aggregate hundreds of transactions off‑chain, compress them into succinct proofs, and submit those proofs to L1 for security and data availability.  
- **Sidechains** operate as independent blockchains with their own consensus, offering rapid finality and low fees at the cost of relying on a separate validator set.  

**High‑Level Architecture**  
*(Insert your diagram here — see guidance below)*  
1. **Sepolia (L1)**  
   - **MyT (BEP‑20)** deployed as the canonical token  
   - **L1Bridge** locks MyT, emits `DepositInitiation`, and later releases tokens on withdrawal  
2. **Relayer (Off‑Chain Service)**  
   - Watches L1 & L2 events  
   - Calls `mintOnL2` on L2Bridge and `releaseOnL1` on L1Bridge  
3. **opBNB (L2 Sidechain/Rollup)**  
   - **MyTWrapped (BEP‑20)** minted/burned by **L2Bridge**  
   - Enables fast, low‑cost transfers

## 2. Comparison: Rollups vs Sidechains

| **Feature**           | **Rollups**                                  | **Sidechains**                              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Security Model**    | Inherits Ethereum/BSC security via proofs     | Secured by its own validators                |
| **Data Availability** | On L1 (full transaction data stored on L1)    | On sidechain only                            |
| **Throughput**        | High (batching hundreds of txs per proof)     | Very high (native block production)          |
| **Transaction Cost**  | Low per tx (amortized over batch)             | Low, but variable based on sidechain load    |
| **Finality**          | Determined by L1 confirmation times           | Determined by sidechain consensus            |
| **Trust Assumptions** | Trust‑minimized (fraud‑proof or ZK‑proof)      | Trust in sidechain validators                |
| **Use Cases**         | Decentralized dApps, DeFi, asset bridging     | Gaming, NFTs, specialized application chains |

## 3. Integration Strategy

### 3.1 Token Deployment & Rollup Scalability  
1. **Canonical Token (MyT)** on Sepolia  
2. **Wrapped Token (MyTWrapped)** on opBNB  
   - Minted/burned by L2Bridge only  
   - Enables cheap transfers and batch settlement  

> **Rollup Benefit:**  
> - Batches user transactions (e.g., 100 deposits) into a single L1 proof  
> - Reduces gas fees and congestion on L1  

### 3.2 Bridging Workflow  

1. **Deposit (L1 → L2)**  
   - User calls `L1Bridge.depositToL2(amount)`  
   - `L1Bridge` locks MyT and emits `DepositInitiation(user, amount, nonce)`  
   - Relayer detects event, calls `L2Bridge.mintOnL2(user, amount, nonce)`  
   - `MyTWrapped` tokens are minted to the user on opBNB  

2. **Withdrawal (L2 → L1)**  
   - User calls `L2Bridge.withdrawToL1(amount)`  
   - `L2Bridge` burns MyTWrapped and emits `WithdrawalInitiated(user, amount, nonce)`  
   - Relayer detects event, calls `L1Bridge.releaseOnL1(user, amount, nonce)`  
   - Locked MyT is released back to the user on Sepolia  

> **Scalability Note:**  
> - Rollup batching can be integrated by having the relayer aggregate multiple mint/burn requests into single L1 or L2 transactions, further amortizing costs.

## 4. ZK Proof Integration

To eliminate reliance on a trusted relayer, we can integrate **Zero‑Knowledge SNARKs**:

1. **Off‑Chain Prover**  
   - Aggregates and verifies user deposit/withdrawal batches  
   - Produces a succinct ZK proof of correct state transitions  

2. **On‑Chain Verifier**  
   - Deployed on L1 (and optionally L2)  
   - Verifies proofs before allowing `mintOnL2` or `releaseOnL1`  
   - Ensures only valid, non‑replayed operations are processed  

> **Benefits:**  
> - **Trust‑Minimized:** No single relayer can mint/burn arbitrarily  
> - **Efficiency:** Verifying a proof is far cheaper than replaying all txs  
> - **Security:** On‑chain verification enforces correctness without revealing user data

### Diagram Creation Tips

- **L1 Region (Sepolia):** Box containing MyT & L1Bridge  
- **Off‑Chain Relayer:** Center box with arrows to both L1 and L2  
- **L2 Region (opBNB):** Box containing L2Bridge & MyTWrapped  
- **Arrows:**  
  - Solid for on‑chain calls (`depositToL2`, `withdrawToL1`, `mintOnL2`, `releaseOnL1`)  
  - Dashed for events (`DepositInitiation`, `WithdrawalInitiated`)  
  - Label each arrow with function/event name and nonce increment
